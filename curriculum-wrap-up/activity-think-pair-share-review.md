# Activity: Think, Pair, Share Review

## Goal

Our goal is to create a review document for _all of the material in **the entire curriculum**_!

To create a document of such impressive scope, we'll work collaboratively! Each collaborator will have the shared responsibility of contributing material. The more clear everyone's contributions are, the more clear everyone's final review material will be!

Our goal is to create a review document that "_has enough depth to be a helpful review at the end of the Ada program_." Therefore, our review materials should focus on:

- Vocabulary and definitions
- Clear examples (code examples or examples of application)
- Descriptions of the 1-3 _most_ _important_ details about the topic

## "Enough Depth For You In Six Months"

Have you ever started a long book, video game, or TV show, dropped it, and then tried to return to it after six months?

<br/>

Did you remember everything you needed to remember in order to get back into it? You might have wanted a recap of the story, what was going on, who the characters are, and what was important. Our goal is to create a "cheat sheet" that gives these kinds of details to you, but about programming.

## Preparation

If the facilitator desires to do a warm-up activity, they should prepare the warm-up activity.

Each group will make a set of review slides or documents. In the end, there should be one shared slide deck or document for the entire class that contains everyone's slides. Depending on the facilitator's preference, it may make sense to prepare empty slide decks for groups or the whole classroom.

## Activity Instructions

Follow directions to be sorted into small groups. All small groups have four sets of topics represented in the Core curriculum.

Within small groups, read the listed topics together. Then, assign one set of topics to each member.

Then, follow the phases Think, Pair, and Share:

1. (~15 min.) Individually create initial review material for your assigned topics and lessons.
1. (~35-40 min.) With a pair, develop the review material into a shareable slide deck.
1. (Remaining time) With a large group, share and present the created review material.
1. In the end, follow instructions to add your review slides to the classroom's collective review document.

### Think Phase

Consider your assigned set of topics. These topics are all names of topics in the curriculum.

In the Think Phase, your goal is to write down the answer to this question: **What are the top 1, 2, or 3 most important takeaways for each topic?**

These notes will be the beginning of a review guide. Write your notes on paper or in a document.

Focus on:

- important vocabulary and clear definitions
- descriptions of important concepts
- straightforward code examples
- descriptions of the lesson's learning goals
- diagrams and images

**It's probably impossible to document everything**.

It's up to **you** to determine and prioritize **the most important information needed** for review. Use the full activity time available.

#### Tips

Start with your responses to the question "What was your biggest takeaway from this lesson?" located at the end of most lessons.

### Pair Phase

Pair with another person in your group. In the pair, one person is Person A, and the other person is Person B.

1. Review Person A's notes in four minutes or less.
    - Person A should describe the most important pieces of content, and ask Person B how clear the review notes are
    - Person B should listen to see how clear and effective the notes are
1. In 15 minutes or less, collaboratively create a maximum of four slides to summarize Person A's notes. Work together to figure out how to best summarize the material.

    Use this time to:

    - Copy and paste code snippets, definitions, and diagrams
    - Organize and highlight important information
    - Summarize material

1. After 15 minutes, move on from Person A's slides, even if the slides are incomplete.
1. In four minutes or less, review Person B's notes, similar to step 1.
1. In 15 minutes or less, collaboratively create slides to summarize Person B's notes.

### Share Phase

Follow directions from the facilitator to share and present the material.
