# Instructor: Activity: Think, Pair, Share Review

## Warm-up: Optional Warm-up With Polling/Mentimeter

Since it's one of the final reviews, I think it's fun to make it feel special with two feel-good nostalgia questions.

If possible, I would create an optional warm-up to this activity by using [mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/)'s word cloud tool for these two questions:

1. What was a memorable moment in the class for you?
1. What was a memorable lightning talk for you?

These questions are ordered and worded intentionally to support personal answers and easy engagement.

An anonymous word cloud would allow students to enjoy the answers of others without feeling the pressure of performing.

## TPS Review

Think-Pair-Share formats are great for getting introverts and extroverts or different kinds of processors on the same page.

Since a curriculum-wide review is a HUUUGE amount of material, and it covers a huuge area, going straight for a mind map may not be as effective in groups of four. (Simon: I'd predict it's effective either individually or in pairs of two students who are comfortable with each other.)

Instead of the mind map, this TPS format is designed to:

1. Create a shared sense of responsibility to make a class "cheat sheet" study guide together. If their slides aren't great quality, then it affects the study quality of the entire guide.
1. Students aren't alone, though! They eventually pair together, and then share in small group.

## But Do a Mind Map if You Feel Like It

If you believe a typical mind map activity (like the other wrap ups for the other units) will work better than the proposed activity, go for the mind map!!!!!!

## Simon Notes

To create the topic list and groupings, I took the name of every topic in the curriculum (that had meaningful lessons) and I listed it. Then, I combined line-items that I thought could be reasonably researched by one person within ~15 minutes, usually by my gauge that the material is light and related. I did this until there were ~24 topics (one topic for each student in a 24-person classroom).

The steps/directions are written intentionally so that students don't have many opportunities to "overrun" each other during the pair phase (whether a student pair has a student who overly critiques or inserts their opinion/material, or a student who gets left behind).

## Didn't Confidently Suggest Pre-making Slide Decks

Having one slide deck for the entire class at the beginning means that 24 users will be touching ~96 slides. I'm not confident that Google Drive can handle that, so I didn't concretely suggest making a slide deck from the beginning.

## IDK Timing Suggestions

I made some informed timing suggestions for the think/pair phase, but please adjust according to what's best for the classroom.

### !end-callout

## Share

I don't really know what the best method for a final presentation is. Should Unit 1 groups (1+2) present to each other? Therefore Unit 2 groups (3+4) present to each other, and Unit 3 (5+6) present to each other? This timing is best if the conversations are deep and there isn't a lot of time left.

If everything has been super speedy and there's interest in it, a large classroom presentation is probably okay.

### !callout-success

## Encourage 5 min. breaks

I'd probably encourage breaks between each phase (think, pair, and share)
